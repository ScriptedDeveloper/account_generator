# account_generator

# Info
This account generator is designed for business users that sell legally obtained alternative accounts for games or platforms. The core of this project was to make the complete system independent of other platforms like Discord or Telegram.

# Usage
1. Execute run.bat to start the backend server.
2. Now, open the account_generator.exe and use the "default" key.
3. Once you are in the Admin panel, there is everything needed. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure to change the admin key to something other than default to prevent unauthorized access!

## Add account type and restock
1. log in to the Admin panel.
2. Press the 5th option and enter the name of the account type.
3. Now, go to the backend server folder and add the accounts under (account type name).txt

Everything else should be pretty much self-explanatory.

# Exposing the Server to the internet
With a little tweaks like port forwarding the server and changing the server URL var in the frontend Source Code, you can expose the Server to the internet! If you need some assistence, do not hesitate to contact me on Github.
